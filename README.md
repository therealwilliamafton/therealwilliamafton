yes I fictionkin William Afton, yes I'm an William Afton irl, and yes I do believe in reincarnation and I do believe I'm a William Reincarnation, if youre uncomfortable about it dont talk to me and DONT do comments about it. Yes, I'm mentally ill/srs.

I suffer with psychopathy and anger issues, BOTH diagnosed, so have it in mind before becoming my friend
and if you ship Willry get the fck away from me, genuinely, it's bloody disgusting, no I don't mind if u ship it but I'll mind if you are using Henry and keeps making ship rpg with me, like, get a life vro and grow up pillock 💔
